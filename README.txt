Timer website for productivity while working. Contains three seperate timers to keep track of
time spent
	- Study
	- Procrastination
	- Break

Each timer will have a current session timer in the middle and a total time spent on the left.
When starting study, procrastination, or break the start button for that activity should be
clicked at the bottom which will end the current session timer, adjust the total timers, and
start the new activity timer.

Individual controls for each timer is on the right side of each if needed. Manual adjustment
of the total timers by + and - one minute are on the tabs of the right side of the timers.

There are three extra functions seen in the navbar tab at the top
	- Break timer - Extra timer for reminders to take breaks and rest eyes every 20 minutes
	- To-do list - Panel to add and remove to-do items to a list
	- Study mode timer switch - Switchs between the total study timer counting up or
				    counting down from set number
